# CabBookingSystem
All functions have been created such that they can be called from the main function.
Workflow of the system is independent of previous function calls. If wrong calls are made eg. chooseCAb() before findCAb(), it will be handled by the exception handler.
The main class is created with the name Tester. All test cases currently have been hard coded in the tester function.
A seperate exception handler class with name BookingException has been created.
